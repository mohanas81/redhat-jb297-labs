redhat-jb297-labs
=================

This repo contains some JavaEE6 projects based on LABs used in the Red Hat JBoss Development: Persistence with Hibernate (JB297) training.

NOTE: These projects are not the original LABs used in the official Red Hat Training. I created it for self-practice based on the official ones provided in the course material.
